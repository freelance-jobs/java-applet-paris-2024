# java-applet-paris-2024

a few days ago someone asked me to write them a java applet to print olympic rings and print "PARIS 2024" on screen. Althought java applets are not common anymore I thought it would be useful to share this code so that anyone else who'd wanna find out how to do it and refer to this and learn from it. 

Here's the full problem

As illustrated in the video of the lab, create a Java application that will step-by-step draw the Olympic rings and then the text "PARIS 2023" whenever user clicks on the "GO!" button
